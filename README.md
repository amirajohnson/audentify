# Audentify
This repository holds the files needed to run Audentify -- includes README, main python file, etc.

Welcome to Audentify!

In order to play the game, you need the following:
- CMU 112 Graphics
- random
- os
- from requests import *
- requests
- sounddevice as sd
- from scipy.io.wavfile import write
- import wavio as wv 
- import speech_recognition as sr
- from selenium import webdriver
- time 
- from selenium.webdriver.chrome.webdriver import WebDriver


To play, you will be given a random word, and you have 10 seconds to sing a song
with that word in it. Our game then translates the players' speech to text. The 
player gains points if the player comes up with a song that has that word in it 
before the ten seconds run out. When the players gets through 10 rounds, 
the game is over!

Audentify can work in both English and Spanish!
